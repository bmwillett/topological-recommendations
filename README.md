# topological recommendations

## INTRODUCTION

The goal of this project is to create a recommendation system which makes use of recent advances in topological data analysis.  Specifically, we will use the Mapper-Classifier algorithm (MCA) of [arXiv:1910.08103](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08103.pdf) to suggest products to users in a way that is robust against outlier user purchases.

The author of the package is Brian Willett (bmwillett1 at gmail).
